## 📖 Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>
JurisAI is transforming the legal consultation process. Before a lawyer even meets their client, they can have a detailed understanding of the client's legal concerns. Through a chatbot conversation, clients provide in-depth information about their case, which is then analyzed and can be relayed to the lawyer. This ensures that even before the actual consultation, lawyers have a foundational understanding of the client's needs.

### 🛠 Technologies Used:
- ReactJS
- OpenAI API

### 🚧 Challenges Faced:
- Navigating the intricacies of the OpenAI API, especially prompt engineering.

### 🔜 Future Improvements:
- Integration of an LLM (Language Model) specifically tailored for the legal field to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## 🔧 Installation <a name="installation"></a>
